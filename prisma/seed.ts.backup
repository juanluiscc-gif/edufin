Money is something we use to buy things we need and want. But what exactly is money, and why do we need it?

## The Story of Money

Long ago, people didn't have money. They would trade things directly. If you had apples and wanted bread, you'd find someone with bread who wanted apples. This is called **bartering**.

But bartering had problems:
- What if no one wanted your apples?
- How many apples equal one loaf of bread?
- How do you save apples for later? They go bad!

So people invented money. Money is special because:
- Everyone agrees it has value
- It doesn't go bad
- It's easy to carry
- You can split it into small amounts

## Types of Money

Today, we have different types of money:
- **Coins** - Metal money for small amounts
- **Bills** - Paper money for larger amounts
- **Digital money** - Money in computers and phones

All of these represent value that we can exchange for goods and services.

## Why Money Matters

Money helps us:
- Buy things we need (food, clothes, shelter)
- Save for things we want
- Trade easily with others
- Measure value consistently

      title: 'Counting Money',
      description: 'Practice identifying and counting coins and bills',
      content: `# Counting Money

Being able to count money is an important skill. Let's practice!

## Coins

In the US, we have these common coins:
- **Penny** = 1 cent (¢) = $0.01
- **Nickel** = 5 cents = $0.05
- **Dime** = 10 cents = $0.10
- **Quarter** = 25 cents = $0.25

## Bills

Common bills include:
- $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100

## Counting Practice

To count money:
1. Sort by type (all pennies together, all nickels together, etc.)
2. Count each type
3. Add them all up

**Example:**
- 3 quarters = 75¢
- 2 dimes = 20¢
- 1 nickel = 5¢
- Total = 75¢ + 20¢ + 5¢ = 100¢ = $1.00

## Making Change

When you buy something, you need to know if you have enough money and how much change you'll get back.

**Example:** You buy a toy for $3.50 and pay with $5.00
- Change = $5.00 - $3.50 = $1.50

Practice counting money every day to get better!`,
